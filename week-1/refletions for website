- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) On the right hand side of your github account, there will be a +. Click that and select the option "create repository" Follow the prompts. On the lower right side there will be a clone option, undernearth that, there will be a link. Copy that link into your terminal with your git file on your computer. This will clone your github repository to your OS.

2) Open Source allows anyone to use the work you have created. They can work from it or modify it at their will. They do not have to pay for this.

3) Open Source seems great for the public, and hell for trying to make money.

4) Licenses are important to protect what you have created so that someone else does not come to use your work without payment.

5) The hardest part of this challange was the pull/push from my git to github. I hate it, I hate it so damn much. I know it is important, but I still hate it.

6) I was able to use two of my friends for help. I will not share them, they are my friends and I am keeping them to myself. I know I am greedy.
