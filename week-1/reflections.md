# 1.2 The Command Line

Shell is the actual communication from the computer and the user while Bash is where the user actually puts the input.
I would have to say that the most challenging part of this assignment would be the memorization. There are a ton of commands to learn, and getting them all down can be a bit of a pain.
I was able to use all of the commands, not all of them on the first go, but eventually with some outside research I got them all to work.
Probably the most important command would be the mv command, the ability to easily move files without having to waste time finding them with a GUI will save me time and effort.
Pwd, gives you where you are in the CLI and the path you used to get there
ls, List what is inside your current folder
mv, Lets you move files and folders from one part of your computer to the other.
cd, changing directory, pretty easy to get what this one does.
../, moves up the path to the folder higher up in the chain, if pwd puts out temp/text and you type ../ you will end up in temp.
touch, lets you create empty files
mkdir, lets you make new folders
less, displaces the contents of a file in a new page on your terminal
rmdir, removes folders
rm, removes files, different from rmdir
help, man on unix, gives you the description and generic uses of what ever command you have called.

# 1.3 Forking and Cloning

1) Instructions: First things first, you need to go to www.github,com  (Links to an external site.)and create an account. When that is done in the upper right corner there is a + sign. You will click that + sign and two options will come up. Click on the one that says "Create Repository". This will take you to a new page, on there you will add the name of the repository, if you want it public or private, any description you would like to add, and if you want to add a license. This is how you Create a Repository. Now for forking one, you go to the same right side of the page. Under the + sign where you created your repository, you click the word fork. Some options of where you want to fork the repository will come up, click on where you want it to go. This will create a version on that profile. To clone this to your computer, copy the HTTP on the lower part of the page. This will be labeled as HTTP clone. Open your command line and go to the folder you wish to save it to. From there type git clone <paste here> and hit enter. This will save onto your computer so you can work on it without changing the master file.
2) I had no struggles setting this up. I learned that git and GitHub are amazingly well made.
