# 1.2 The Command Line

Shell is the actual communication from the computer and the user while Bash is where the user actually puts the input.
I would have to say that the most challenging part of this assignment would be the memorization. There are a ton of commands to learn, and getting them all down can be a bit of a pain.
I was able to use all of the commands, not all of them on the first go, but eventually with some outside research I got them all to work.
Probably the most important command would be the mv command, the ability to easily move files without having to waste time finding them with a GUI will save me time and effort.
Pwd, gives you where you are in the CLI and the path you used to get there
ls, List what is inside your current folder
mv, Lets you move files and folders from one part of your computer to the other.
cd, changing directory, pretty easy to get what this one does.
../, moves up the path to the folder higher up in the chain, if pwd puts out temp/text and you type ../ you will end up in temp.
touch, lets you create empty files
mkdir, lets you make new folders
less, displaces the contents of a file in a new page on your terminal
rmdir, removes folders
rm, removes files, different from rmdir
help, man on unix, gives you the description and generic uses of what ever command you have called.
