/*
-What is important in linking file.
*Having the correct path laid out is the most important part in linking a cSS file

-What tricks did you use with position.
*I used a lot of centering, <br> tags were also extreamly helpful

-What css was used?
*I used all sorts of things from color, to font size. Padding, margins. text-align.

-Did you add Id and clasS?
*I added some classes and a few ids. I did this mainly to make things easier to use for lines and to change elements.

-Whos code was better?
*I would say that their code was much better. Not that this upsets me, they paid someone to do this and I have been on this for 3 weeks.
