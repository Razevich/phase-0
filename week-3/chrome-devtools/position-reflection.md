Reflections!!!!

1) The dev tools can help you format elements because you can see what changing code will do before you actually change it. It also gives you a display box to show you what part you are changing.

2)You can resize the elements by changing different code in the DOM with the css effects.

3) The difference is how they effect other divs around them. The easiest to use was fixed because it stays constant.

4) Margin is outside of the box and the boarder, the boarder is the lines around your div, padding is between your content inside the div and the boarder.

5) This was a fun challange, a little frustrating at times but still very fun.
