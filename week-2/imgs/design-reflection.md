The Primary goal of my site is to have potential employers learn about what I have done, also to have them contact me with job opportunities. My site will feature what I have done in the past, and my current projects that I am working on.

My target audience's interest will be in my work. My site will address this by having my body of work in a easily accessed place.

The action a user should take when coming to my site is to gain information about me and my portfolio. I also want them to be able to contact me easily.

Design is very important. If you want people to give you money, you need to make it easy for them. If you want someone to come back to your site, the UX needs to be good to them. If they have a horrible time on your site, they are not coming back.

UX design is how a user felt when on your site. It is the challenge of making a user feel good while on your web page. It is important because if a user is comfortable while on your page, they will spend more time there. More time is more information given out, or more money to be spent.
