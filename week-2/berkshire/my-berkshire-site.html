  <!-- It was a pretty easy job to replicate the website. It should be more fun when we get to CSS.
   - Using HTML5 items was really fun and easy.
   - The best ways to practice is to just code every day.
   - Html has so many great things about it. A great easy way to structer a website. There really are no major drawbacks that I can think of right now.
   - There is no trick, it just takes a lot of coding to memorize it. -->
