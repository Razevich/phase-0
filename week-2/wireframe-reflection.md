* Wireframes are a way of laying out a website so that you have the basic idea of design before you start to code.

* The benifits are knowing what your website will look like before you actually start to code

* I did not enjoy wireframing, so many options that I just never think I have it right.

* I revised my wireframe a few times, still think it sucks. I should really just draw my ideas instead of using the web.

* No real questions that I asked.

* I enjoyed thinking about my website, I hated actually trying to plan it out.
